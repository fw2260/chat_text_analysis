# chat_text_analysis

This is a fun little personal project in R that I decided to make for my friends with whom I have a Facebook group chat with that we named The Plastics (reference to Mean Girls, because there are four of us). I wanted to try using the tidytext package to do some text and sentiment analysis. In the process, I also used R's tidyverse, stringr, rvest, wordcloud, among other packages. 

The final product is an html page with graphs and observations that I found interesting and relevant to us. However, for privacy's sake, I did not put the actual messages in the repo.
