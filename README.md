# chat_text_analysis

This is a fun little personal project that I decided to make for my friends with whom I have a Facebook group chat with that we named The Plastics (reference to Mean Girls, because there are four of us). I wanted to try using the tidytext package to do some text and sentiment analysis. However, for privacy's sake, I will not be putting the actual messages in the repo.
